# FDJ

## Requirement

Launch `MongoDB` server on `localhost`.

The database name should be `fdj`.

The collections `leagues`, `teams` and `players` should be restored in the database from `./docs/sports.zip`.

So, this application only runs on `mongodb://localhost/fdj` and no credentials are required.

## Install and run

Run `npm install` and `npm start` in both `./back` and `./front` folders.
